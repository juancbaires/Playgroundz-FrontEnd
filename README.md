### Pickup Games


## Planning
We as a group came up with several of ideas and wanted to narrow down on a real word problem based on our experience.

We narrowed down our choices to provide a solution for anyone who wants to gather/host/enjoy pickup games in their community.

Used an ERD to define relationships and data flow throughout our application.

## MODELS
User
Event
RSVP

Drew our flow of how we want a user to interact with our application and what components could be rendered on the components.

## List of Features
- Full CRUD functionality
- Quick and easy signup and login with Passport-JWT
- Mobile first design
- Responsive layout


## List of Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Passport.js
- JWT(JSONWEBTOKEN)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Materialize
- JavaScript (ES6)
- MLab
- Heroku
- ReactJS
- Surge


## Problem Solving
One of the biggest things we did to solve problems was discussing and revisiting our drawings of flow and models. It always helps to have a second eye and review the code also.

When making changes, we communicated as a team and let eachother know what part we are working on so we wouldnt have multiple people on one specific section.
